											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt="" /></span>

											<p>Idaho Falls is about to have a lot more pollinators with the hard work of a dedicated 
											and skilled retired soldier Blake Brimhall. With an Army career spanning over thirty years, 
											he served in both Desert Storm and Shield operations. After years of specializing in Air Defense 
											throughout the Pacific Region he went from focusing on THAAD and Patriot Missile Defense systems to developing 
											his own much smaller (and honey producing) objects-in-flight program.</p>

											<p>While starting his retirement in Hawaii, his wife encouraged him to find a hobby. Blake 
											began studying YouTube videos on beekeeping and along with his son’s encouragement, he’s 
											gone from catching a wild swarm of bees in Hawaii to successfully maintaining multiple hives 
											outside of his present home the Gem state’s southeastern corner.</p>

											<p>In the spring of 2021, he built eight hives and in order to keep costs down, constructed 
											nearly all of them from recycled shipping material. “When we moved here all our items came 
											in crates and they were going to throw them away. I said Whoa! Lemme keep them crates! I broke 
											all the crates down and kept the quarter inch plywood…so my first year I built all my hives and frames.”</p>
											
											<p>He started with a variety of types of bees: local, Italian, Carniolin, and Saskatraz. 
											The first and second winter were hard, and he lost five hives. The third winter brought 
											another loss in the form of the dreaded mite. While he’s traditionally found oxalic acid treatments 
											are effective, the cold weather created a barrier with its success. The Idaho winters bring long deep freezes, 
											copious amounts of snowfall, and with those fluctuations’ humidity challenges. Each heartache brought with it a new 
											valuable lesson: Certain hive designs work best in certain applications. Slight adaptations like using a wool pillow for 
											sudden temperature drops can help. Using Hive Alive fondant can support colony health. And finding the effective timing 
											for mite management.</p>

											<p>With a few years of beekeeping under his belt, the next goal is to eventually start 
											marketing honey to his local community under the Homegrown by Heroes program. “I can’t 
											say I ever really thought I would be a beekeeper, but the more I keep bees the more I love them.” 
											Encouraged to apply to the Fellowship Fund program by a learning module in Dr. Adam Ingrao’s Heroes to Hives program,
											he’s pleased to be continuing to pursue this journey.</p>

											<p>Before becoming a recipient of the Fellowship Fund program Blake wasn’t sure he was 
											going to continue beekeeping. “I really thought I was going to quit bees, but I didn’t 
											want to. The bees give me a lot of happiness.” By receiving the FVCFellowship through the generous support of 
											AgWest Farm Credit he will be adding a honey extractor, five hives, and five swarm traps to his business aptly named 
											“Bee Right Back Bees”.</p>
